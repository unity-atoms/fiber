# Cursor Manager

An implementation to manage the cursor in Unity. Works standalone and with Fiber. 

## Future
Currently we expose CursorManager and CursorManagerComponent in this package. We could in the future break out CursorManagerComponent to its own package in order to not force consumers to use Fiber.
